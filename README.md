# Image-Retrieval
This is an image retrieval system that creates image embeddings from CNN activation layers to extract image features and compute a breed of image-image similarity that suprisingly correlates
with human judgments of artistic similarity. It contains one notebook where the code to dowloand the dataset, process the images and implement the retrieval system can be found.
To demo this system, run the notebook `ArtisticSimilarity_G.ipynb` located in the `notebooks` directory.
